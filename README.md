# AirBnB Clone Project

## 🏡 Overview

This project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB platform. It aims to replicate the core features such as listing properties, booking stays, and user interactions in a full-stack web application.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn how full-stack web applications are structured.
- Understand the MVC pattern and RESTful API principles.
- Practice with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Build backend logic using Python/Flask (or Node.js, depending on the track).
- Work with data persistence using MySQL or a JSON-based system.
- Deploy a minimal version of the app.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask) or Node.js
- **Database:** MySQL / JSON
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Status

Project is in early development phase. Initial setup and planning completed.

## 📁 Repository Structure (to be updated as code is added)

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning

A clean and intuitive user interface is critical for the success of any booking platform. The goal is to ensure users can easily browse properties, view detailed information, and complete bookings with minimal friction.

### 🧭 Design Goals

- Ensure a **responsive layout** across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Use **consistent branding and styling** for a modern, professional look.
- Focus on **usability and accessibility**.
- Enable users to **quickly find and book** accommodations with as few steps as possible.
- Minimize cognitive load by presenting information clearly and simply.

### 🌟 Key Features to Implement

- **Search bar** for filtering listings by city, date, and guest count.
- **Navigation bar** with links to Home, Login/Register, and Bookings.
- **Cards or grid layout** for displaying property previews.
- **Interactive elements** like buttons, hover states, and forms with validation.
- **Dark mode or theme toggle (optional enhancement).**

### 📄 Page Overview

| Page                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Property Listing View** | A homepage or search results page that displays all available properties in a grid or card layout. Each property includes a thumbnail image, name, price per night, and a short description. Users can click on a property to view more details. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | A single property page that shows detailed information including full description, multiple images, amenities, location map, host info, and a “Book Now” button.                                                                                 |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | A form-based page where the user inputs booking details like dates, number of guests, and payment information. It includes a summary of the booking and a final confirmation button.                                                             |

### 💡 Why User-Friendly Design Matters

A user-friendly design:

- Improves **conversion rates** by making booking easy and stress-free.
- Reduces **user drop-off**, especially on mobile.
- Builds **trust and professionalism**, encouraging repeat users.
- Ensures that users of all skill levels can interact with the platform.

Our UI/UX approach is to prioritize simplicity, clarity, and speed — key factors in a successful and scalable booking platform.

### 🎨 Figma Design Properties

As part of exploring the Figma environment, we identified consistent design tokens to be applied across the project.

#### 🎨 Color Styles

| Name             | HEX Code  | Usage                            |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Primary Color    | `#FF5A5F` | Main actions (e.g. buttons, CTA) |
| Secondary Color  | `#008489` | Accents, links, highlights       |
| Background Color | `#FFFFFF` | Page and section backgrounds     |
| Primary Text     | `#222222` | Headings and body text           |
| Secondary Text   | `#717171` | Subheadings, muted text          |

#### ✍️ Typography

| Style          | Font     | Weight       | Size      | Usage                      |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------ | --------- | -------------------------- |
| Primary Text   | Circular | Medium (500) | 16px      | Body content               |
| Headings       | Circular | Bold (700)   | 24px–32px | Titles and section headers |
| Secondary Text | Circular | Book (400)   | 14px      | Captions, helper text      |

### 🧠 Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Identifying and documenting key design properties from the mockup ensures:

- ✅ **Design Consistency**: Every part of the application reflects a unified visual language.
- 🔄 **Efficient Development**: Developers reference exact colors and typography — no guesswork.
- 🧩 **Component Reusability**: Shared tokens can be used across components for maintainable code.
- 🤝 **Better Collaboration**: Designers and developers speak the same "design system" language.
- 🌐 **Improved UX**: Clear type hierarchy and proper contrast enhance readability and accessibility.

By translating Figma’s styles into actual development tokens, we ensure a faithful implementation of the original design vision.
